##DAY 6##

The raw input for the code is a text doc with groups of single-line entries of letters a-z.

Each line represents a series of answers from one person, each block represents a group of answers to be considered together.

#Part 1#

The goal is to keep track of the total number of letters that appear in each group, with the ultimate answer being the sum of all the group answers.

#Part 2#

The goal is changed to keeping track of all the letters that appear in _every_ answer in a group, with the ultimate answer being the total sum of all group answers.
